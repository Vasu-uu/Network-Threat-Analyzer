## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Traffic Classification Model is a real-time intelligent system designed to detect and classify network traffic as **malicious** or **safe** using flow-level features.

Built with a **Random Forest machine learning model**, the system is deployed via a simple and efficient **Flask web interface**. It supports `.csv` file uploads, analyzes the data, and visualizes the results instantly.

---

## Key Features

* Real-time classification of uploaded `.csv` traffic logs  
* AI-powered Random Forest model trained on UNSW-NB15  
* Visualization with Chart.js (pie chart: malicious vs. safe)  
* Flask-based web interface for ease of use  
* Display of predicted traffic labels with protocol and classification only (e.g., Safe/Malicious)  

---

## Dataset Used

**UNSW-NB15** – A labeled dataset containing both normal and malicious network traffic.

Includes:

* DoS  
* Exploits (including SQL Injection, XSS, Buffer Overflow, Shellcode, etc.)  
* Fuzzers  
* Reconnaissance  
* Analysis  
* Backdoors

## Tech Stack

| Layer        | Technologies                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Language     | Python                              |
| Backend      | Flask, Flask-CORS                   |
| ML Libraries | Scikit-learn, Joblib, Pandas, NumPy |
| Frontend     | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js     |

---

## Outcomes

* Achieved accurate classification of malicious vs. safe traffic using a Random Forest model.  
* Designed a user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing `.csv` network logs.  
* Successfully integrated real-time visualization of predictions using Chart.js.  
* Demonstrated the practicality of ML models in supporting automated network threat detection in a lightweight environment.  

---

## Limitations

* The model is trained only on offline flow data and does not process live packet capture.  
* Limited to `.csv` files with specific feature formatting; data preprocessing must match training setup.  
* Accuracy and generalization may reduce on real-world enterprise networks due to differences from training data.  
* Does not show full metadata like source/destination IP, time, etc., which can help with deeper threat investigation.  

---

## Future Scope

* Extend the system to support real-time packet sniffing using tools like `PyShark` or `Scapy`.  
* Add detailed analytics with IP/port-level information and interactive dashboards.  
* Integrate alerting systems (e.g., email, Telegram) for critical threat detections.  
* Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, CNN) for improved accuracy on complex patterns.  
* Provide cloud deployment for scalability and integration with existing SIEM tools.
