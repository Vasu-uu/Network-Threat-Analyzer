## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI-Powered Traffic Classification Model** is a real-time intelligent system designed to detect and classify network traffic as **malicious** or **safe** using flow-level features.

Built with a **Random Forest machine learning model**, the system is deployed via a simple and efficient **Flask web interface**. It supports `.csv` file uploads, analyzes the data, and visualizes the results instantly.

---

## 💡 Key Features

* 🔍 Real-time classification of uploaded `.csv` traffic logs
* 🧠 AI-powered Random Forest model trained on UNSW-NB15
* 📈 Visualization with **Chart.js** (pie chart: malicious vs. safe)
* 🌐 Flask-based web interface for ease of use
* 🧾 Display of predicted traffic labels with IP/Port details

---

## 📚 Dataset Used

**UNSW-NB15** – A labeled dataset containing both normal and malicious network traffic.

Includes:

* DoS
* Exploits (including SQL Injection, XSS, Buffer Overflow, Shellcode, etc.)
* Fuzzers
* Reconnaissance
* Analysis
* Backdoors
